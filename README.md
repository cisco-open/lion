## Installation 

Simply clone this repository. Simple as that! 

Will need to install libraries, including: 
- streamlit
- matrixprofile 
- openai 

> A conda `.env` file containing all required packages will be added shortly! 

***IMPORTANT: Run `pip install protobuf==3.20.0`, as streamlit and matrixprofile are not compatible otherwise***

Once all necessary pacakges are installed, this project should run with ease!

A demo video will be posted soon with instructions on features/usage.
